# Gene Expression PCA

This repository contains a technical demonstration of a standard PCA-based exploratory workflow for gene expression data.

It includes normalization, transformation, PCA computation, and basic visualization to inspect global sample structure in high-dimensional expression matrices.

The project is intended as a technical reference and is not under active development.

It does not perform biological interpretation, differential analysis, or production-grade modeling.
